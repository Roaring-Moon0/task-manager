A clean, powerful, and *surprisingly satisfying* task manager built with **Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no reloads, no nonsense 😎

This project started simple… and then evolved into a **full-featured task app** with real app logic, clean state management, and smooth UX.

- 🔄 One render function for everything
- 🎯 Event delegation (no unnecessary listeners)
- 💾 Persistent state with proper rewrites
- ⚡ Instant UI updates (no page refresh)
- 🧹 Refactored from 350+ lines to ~200 lines

Basically…  
**Real app thinking, not just DOM tricks 🤦‍♂️**
